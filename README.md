## Course Overview
### V1 Motivating Example: Building a Meal Plan with a Fusion of Food from Ethiopia and Uzbekistan that is Keto
The speaker emphasizes that **large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are tools for ideation and iteration**, not just for answering questions or writing essays. They enable **rapid prototyping and refinement** of ideas that would otherwise be difficult or costly to execute.

#### **Example: Meal Plan Exploration**
- The speaker wanted to create a **keto-friendly meal plan** fusing **Uzbek and Ethiopian cuisine** with ingredients from an average US grocery store.
- ChatGPT generated a **structured meal plan** with detailed dishes and ingredient accessibility.
- It **suggested serving sizes** within a **2000-calorie limit**, refining the idea further.

#### **Making It Engaging for a Child**
- The speaker needed to **interest his nine-year-old son**, who is hesitant to try new foods.
- Asked ChatGPT to generate **Pokemon-themed battle stories** for each dish with **cliffhangers** to engage his son.
- The AI produced a **thematic story** that connected the meal with an adventure.

#### **Enhancing Learning with Games**
- At dinner, the family discusses **school topics**, especially **math games**.
- The speaker requested ChatGPT to create a **math game using Pokemon and nutrition concepts**.
- ChatGPT **posed interactive fraction-based math questions**, making the learning process fun.

#### **Turning the Idea into Software**
- Wanting to make the game **more tangible**, the speaker asked ChatGPT to generate **Python code for a web application**.
- ChatGPT produced a **working software prototype**, integrating the math game.

#### **Key Takeaways**
- **LLMs facilitate rapid ideation and refinement**, turning abstract ideas into tangible outcomes.
- **Iteration is key**—each step builds on the previous one, improving functionality.
- **Beyond text generation**, AI can help in planning, storytelling, interactive learning, and even software development.
- **The goal is not just a one-off answer but an evolving process**, where ideas take shape in various forms.

The speaker encourages **thinking of AI as a co-creator**, leveraging its capabilities for creative and complex problem-solving.

### V2 Overview of the Course
#### **Introduction**
- **Instructor:** Jules White, Associate Professor of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University.
- **Course Focus:** **Prompt Engineering**—how to effectively interact with large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
- **Goal:** Inspire students to **explore LLMs beyond common misconceptions** (e.g., cheating, plagiarism) and see them as tools to **unlock creativity** and **enhance problem-solving**.

#### **What are Large Language Models?**
- ChatGPT is a **LLM** that can be used for:
  - **Knowledge exploration**
  - **Prototyping**
  - **Content production**
  - **Assessment**
- These models **amplify human capability**, allowing faster execution of creative and technical tasks.

#### **Who Can Take This Course?**
- **No programming experience required.**
- Basic computer skills (file management, using ChatGPT) are helpful.
- Strong **writing skills** and **creative thinking** improve prompt effectiveness.
- **Openness to experimentation** is essential, as best practices are still evolving.

#### **Why Creativity Matters**
- The effectiveness of LLMs depends on the **creativity of the user**.
- **Prompt design** plays a crucial role in getting high-quality outputs.
- Users must be **willing to iterate, experiment, and refine prompts** for optimal results.

#### **Key Concepts Covered in the Course**
1. **Understanding Prompts** – Writing effective inputs to program LLMs for high-quality responses.
2. **Prompt Techniques** – Using patterns like persona-based prompts, question refinement, and cognitive verification.
3. **Prompt Optimization** – Refining prompts through rewriting, combining, splitting, and expanding.
4. **Practical Applications** – Applying LLMs to areas like research, ideation, content creation, and problem-solving.
5. **Few-shot Learning** – Teaching LLMs new tasks using example-driven prompts.

#### **Encouragement to Explore**
- **LLMs are tools for accelerating creativity**—users should leverage them to **bring ideas to life** faster.
- **Iterate and refine ideas continuously** to discover new possibilities.
- The course encourages **hands-on experimentation** with LLMs to unlock their full potential.

#### **Conclusion**
- **Main Theme:** Use LLMs as a tool to **realize and refine ideas**, rather than just answering questions.
- **Objective:** Equip learners with skills to **craft prompts strategically** and maximize AI’s creative potential.
- **Final Message:** Explore, experiment, and use LLMs as a **partner in creativity and problem-solving**.

### V3 Motivating Example: Act as a Speech Pathologist
#### **Introduction to the Persona Pattern**  
- **Prompt engineering unlocks advanced capabilities** of ChatGPT and other LLMs.  
- The **Persona Pattern** is a structured way to **ask AI to act as an expert** (e.g., a speech pathologist, doctor, or even an object).  
- This technique **enables AI to generate expert-like insights**, even in fields where the user has no expertise.  

#### **Example: AI as a Speech-Language Pathologist**  
- The speaker used **ChatGPT to assess a child's speech** with the prompt:  
  _"Act as a speech-language pathologist. I will provide a speech sample from a three-year-old, and you will write an assessment."_  
- The **speech sample** provided was: _“I meed way woy.”_  
- ChatGPT generated a **structured report**, identifying:  
  - **Phonological and articulation errors**  
  - **Consonant sound issues** (e.g., difficulty pronouncing "n" and "l")  
  - **Syllable structure problems** (e.g., "way" instead of "play" due to cluster reduction)  

#### **Key Observations**  
- The **AI inferred the intended words** based on phonetic patterns.  
- It provided **terminology and analysis** (e.g., "cluster reduction"), which the user wouldn’t have known to ask for.  
- It **included a disclaimer** noting that **speech development varies in children**, reinforcing responsible AI use.  

#### **Real-World Impact and AI’s Role**  
- The speaker’s **wife, a real speech pathologist,** found the AI’s report detailed but **potentially excessive for a real-world case**.  
- AI is **not replacing professionals** but can **assist in routine tasks**, such as drafting reports, allowing experts to focus on direct patient interaction.  

#### **Conclusion**  
- **Well-structured prompts unlock deep AI capabilities** that users may not realize exist.  
- The **Persona Pattern helps users access domain-specific knowledge** without being experts themselves.  
- **AI is a tool for efficiency, not replacement**, freeing up professionals for higher-value tasks.  
- **With the right prompt structures, AI can bring ideas to life and enhance problem-solving.**
