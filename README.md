### 1.1.V3 Motivating Example: Act as a Speech Pathologist
#### **Introduction to the Persona Pattern**  
- **Prompt engineering unlocks advanced capabilities** of ChatGPT and other LLMs.  
- The **Persona Pattern** is a structured way to **ask AI to act as an expert** (e.g., a speech pathologist, doctor, or even an object).  
- This technique **enables AI to generate expert-like insights**, even in fields where the user has no expertise.  

#### **Example: AI as a Speech-Language Pathologist**  
- The speaker used **ChatGPT to assess a child's speech** with the prompt:  
  _"Act as a speech-language pathologist. I will provide a speech sample from a three-year-old, and you will write an assessment."_  
- The **speech sample** provided was: _“I meed way woy.”_  
- ChatGPT generated a **structured report**, identifying:  
  - **Phonological and articulation errors**  
  - **Consonant sound issues** (e.g., difficulty pronouncing "n" and "l")  
  - **Syllable structure problems** (e.g., "way" instead of "play" due to cluster reduction)  

#### **Key Observations**  
- The **AI inferred the intended words** based on phonetic patterns.  
- It provided **terminology and analysis** (e.g., "cluster reduction"), which the user wouldn’t have known to ask for.  
- It **included a disclaimer** noting that **speech development varies in children**, reinforcing responsible AI use.  

#### **Real-World Impact and AI’s Role**  
- The speaker’s **wife, a real speech pathologist,** found the AI’s report detailed but **potentially excessive for a real-world case**.  
- AI is **not replacing professionals** but can **assist in routine tasks**, such as drafting reports, allowing experts to focus on direct patient interaction.  

#### **Conclusion**  
- **Well-structured prompts unlock deep AI capabilities** that users may not realize exist.  
- The **Persona Pattern helps users access domain-specific knowledge** without being experts themselves.  
- **AI is a tool for efficiency, not replacement**, freeing up professionals for higher-value tasks.  
- **With the right prompt structures, AI can bring ideas to life and enhance problem-solving.**

### 1.1.R1 Setting Up an Account and Using ChatGPT

## 1.2 Large Language Models Basics
### 1.2.V1 What are Large Language Models?

#### **What Are Large Language Models (LLMs)?**  
- **LLMs generate text by predicting the next word** based on the input prompt.  
- They **continue generating words** until they determine the response is complete.  
- Responses are built **word by word** using learned language patterns.  

#### **How Do They Work?**  
- Trained on **large datasets from the internet**, learning from text across different domains.  
- Given **partial sentences**, the model **predicts the next word** and refines its response iteratively.  
- Example:  
  - Prompt: _"Mary had a little..."_ → Model predicts **"lamb"** based on learned patterns.  
  - Prompt: _"Roses are red..."_ → Model completes with **"Violets are blue..."**  
- **Context-awareness** is key—models use previous words to make more accurate predictions.  

#### **Rapid Evolution of LLMs**  
- Many models exist beyond ChatGPT: **GPT-4, LLaMa, Alpaca, and others**.  
- The field of **prompt engineering is evolving**, meaning best practices will change over time.  
- **Users should experiment** to adapt to new models and capabilities.  

#### **Key Characteristics of LLMs**  
1. **Outputs May Vary** –  
   - Not always deterministic; the same prompt may yield **different responses**.  
   - Adds **randomness** to improve diversity in text generation.  
2. **Training Data Cutoff** –  
   - Knowledge is limited to when the model was last trained (**e.g., ChatGPT’s knowledge stops at 2021**).  
   - **To include new information**, users must **provide it in the prompt**.  
3. **Not Always Perfect** –  
   - First responses may **contain errors or require refinement**.  
   - Users should iterate and **fine-tune prompts** for better outputs.  

#### **Takeaways for Effective Prompting**  
- **Think of LLMs as tools, not static knowledge bases.**  
- **Design prompts carefully** to leverage their ability to predict and refine responses.  
- **Experimentation and creativity** are key to unlocking their full potential.  
- **Be aware of their limitations** (e.g., outdated knowledge, non-deterministic responses).  

This foundational knowledge will help in writing **better prompts** throughout the course.

### 1.2.V2 Randomness in Output
#### **LLMs Are Not Always Exact or Repeatable**  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs) have inherent randomness**—they won’t always generate the same response for the same input.  
- This **variability is intentional** and can be beneficial in **creative tasks** (e.g., storytelling) but **problematic for precise reasoning** (e.g., Yes/No answers).  
- **Prompt engineering helps control unpredictability**, but **no method guarantees perfect consistency** every time.  

#### **Demonstration of Randomness**  
- The speaker asked **ChatGPT**: _"How many birds are outside my house?"_  
- Each response varied slightly:  
  - **Response 1:** AI explains it **can't perceive the world** and suggests observing outside or setting up a bird feeder.  
  - **Response 2:** AI again states **it has no access to real-world data** but suggests setting up a **camera** instead.  
  - **Response 3:** AI offers similar reasoning but **doesn’t mention cameras**, instead suggesting **bird baths**.  
- **Key takeaway:** Even with a constrained question, **answers are not identical** but follow a similar structure.  

#### **Why This Matters in Prompt Engineering**  
- **LLMs generate variations based on probability**, selecting words that fit the context but aren’t fixed.  
- **This variability must be accounted for** when designing prompts for reliable outputs.  
- **If precision is needed**, users may need to **structure prompts more explicitly** or provide additional context.  

#### **Conclusion**  
- **Expect variation in responses**—LLMs are **not deterministic** like traditional computer programs.  
- **Prompt engineering techniques help reduce randomness**, but some degree of variability is inevitable.  
- **Understanding this behavior is crucial** for crafting effective prompts, especially when seeking **consistent** or **highly structured outputs**.
